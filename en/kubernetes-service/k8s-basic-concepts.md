The Kubernetes standalone plugin enables CloudOps to serve as a console for managing the complete lifyecycle of a Kubernetes-based application, from infrastructure deployment to update release, without having to be concerned with managing the control plane.

Requires a connection to an existing Kubernetes cluster.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/

To create, modify, or delete Kubernetes resources, a user's account must be a member of the environment which is connected to the cluster, and also have the *Editor* or *Owner* environment role assigned.  An account with the *Administrator* role or higher in the organization may create, modify, or delete resources in an environment.

To manage Kubernetes resources, navigate to the desired Kubernetes service connection in the sidebar, and then select the desired environment.
