## About this task

This article will guide you through the steps required to generate a key for accessing your account via the CloudOps API.

## Before you begin

-   You must be logged into the CloudOps Web user interface

## Procedure

1.  Click on the **User Settings** menu in the upper-right corner of the UI.

2.  When the User Settings drawer appears, click on **API Credentials**.

3.  Click on the **Generate API Key** button.

4.  When the key value appears, copy it by clicking on the clipboard icon.

5.  Click on the **Done** button. You may now close the User Settings drawer.


## Results

-   The API key is now in your clipboard.

    **Note:** Store your key securely. You will not be able to view it again in the UI after the User Settings drawer is closed.

-   If you wish, you can rename your API key instead of using the randomly-generated default name.
