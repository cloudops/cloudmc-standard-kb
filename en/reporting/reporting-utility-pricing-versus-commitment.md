CloudOps supports two models for allocating usage charges to customers:

-   **Utility pricing**

    Utility pricing calculates the appropriate charges for usage based on the prices defined by the reseller in the monetization settings. The defined rate is applied to the quantity of usage throughout the billing cycle, and any applicable discounts or credits are included in this calculation. If there is no usage, there is no charge.

    This model is also known as pay-as-you-go, or pay-per-use. Because it is variable, it is always post-paid \(invoiced at the end of the billing cycle\). Utility pricing allows a customer to pay only for what they use, and provides flexibility for increasing or decreasing workloads as needed.

-   **Commitment**

    Commitments are fixed-term agreements between a reseller and a customer. The customer agrees to purchase a fixed quantity of product every month for a specific price. Since this is guaranteed monthly recurring revenue, the reseller is incentivized to extend a more competitive rate on the commitment.

    When negotiating a commitment, it is important that the customer be able to forecast optimal usage of the product, because the customer will pay the agreed-upon price whether or not they use the full quantity during that month. Unused portions of a commitment do not carry over to the next billing cycle.


All usage reports indicate utility and commitment usage separately.
