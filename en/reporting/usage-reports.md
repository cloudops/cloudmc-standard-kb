CloudOps usage reports are very closely related to the monetization system. These reports are generated from usage data that has been collected, processed, and stored for the current and previous billing cycles. They provide cost data because charges have been calculated accordingly based on the usage and the configured monetization settings, as well as for any applicable commitments in the billing cycle. Billing cycles, dates, and other attributes that appear on reports are controlled from the **Admin** &gt; **Billing** section of the interface. The actual products and prices which appear on reports are controlled from the **Admin** &gt; **Monetization** section.

The system always attempts to provide the most recent data possible. However, the availability of data depends on the remote service, and there can always be some sort of delay in reporting usage. Some services do not guarantee the integrity of their billing data until several days after the close of their own billing cycles.

The usage reports are intended to help managers and resellers understand their spending trends and how their product offerings are being utilized. For example, it can be very useful to see fluctuations over a given year and to identify time frames where infrastructure might be spun down to save on costs. Conversely, it can help to see where sustained usage might mean that signing onto a commitment would be advisable. Usage reports can also be invaluable for troubleshooting problems, such as isolating spikes in usage or unexpected drops in consumption.

When looking at usage reports on a day-to-day basis, it is important to bear in mind that several events can skew the reporting. For example, some cloud providers might report the cost for all reserved instances at once. This would result in a one-day apparent spike in usage, instead of being evenly spread across the month. Similarly, because there may be a delay in reporting due to the policies of the cloud provider, a charge may suddenly appear on a day in the past where previously there had been no such charge. Familiarity with the nuances of each cloud provider can help understand these behaviors.
