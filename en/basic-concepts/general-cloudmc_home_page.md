The CloudOps home page is the default page a user is presented with when logging into the system.

1.  **Workspace**

    The workspace is the main section of all CloudOps screens. The items that are visible in the workspace are determined by the context of where you are in the system. For example, in the home page listed here, you can find the services map, the quick access panel, as well as summaries of system health and recent activity.

2.  **Sidebar**

    The sidebar is on the left-hand side of any CloudOps screen. The sidebar is where you can navigate to all of the major features of the system, including service connections, reporting, activity logs, and administration.

3.  **Organization picker**

    CloudOps is a multi-tenant platform. Use the organization picker to navigate between the organizations and sub-organizations you have access to. Note that the branding of the user interface may change when you switch to a different organization.

4.  **Menu bar**

    Across the top of all screens is the menu bar. The right-hand side of the menu bar contains three items: the help menu, the notifications menu, and the User Settings menu.

5.  **Collapse gadget**

    Click on the collapse gadget to minimize the sidebar. This will make more room available for the workspace. Items in the sidebar will still be visible via their icons.
